## Project Description
Employment trends are a critical aspect of understanding the socio-economic landscape of any region. This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of employment rates in various African regions, with a focus on the years 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2021. The aim is to provide valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers by examining how employment rates have evolved over time, understanding disparities, and identifying the influence of industries and regions.

## Scope of the Project

The project will focus on the following key aspects:

- Analyzing employment rates in different sectors (Agriculture, Industry, Services) across African regions.
- Investigating employment trends categorized by gender (Male, Female, Male and Female).
- Exploring changes in employment rates over the years 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2021.

## Dataset

We will be using a dataset containing employment information for African regions. The dataset includes the following details:

- Region: The African region where the data was collected.
- Year: The year in which the data was recorded (2005, 2010, 2015, 2021).
- Category: The sector category (Agriculture, Industry, Services).
- Gender: Gender category (Male, Female, Male and Female).
- Employment rate(%): The percentage of employment in the specified category.

## Attribute Information

- Region: Categorical
- Year: Numeric (Discrete)
- Category: Categorical
- Gender: Categorical
- Employment rate(%): Numeric (Continuous)

## Data Preparation and Validation

Before conducting any analysis, the dataset will undergo the following data preparation steps:
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
- Data transformation: If needed, transforming data to a suitable format.
- Validation: Ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in understanding the dataset. We will perform the following tasks:
- Summarize key statistics and visualizations.
- Identify trends and patterns.
- Investigate relationships between variables.
- Generate visualizations to make data insights more interpretable.

## Installation
